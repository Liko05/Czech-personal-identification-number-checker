# Czech-personal-identication-number-checker

At first it was school project but i havent seen anything like this update on the internet so i decided to release it.

This program is used to check if personal identification number is valid if yes then it prints out information like gender day month and year of birth.
Its heavily commented so i hope it will help someone with learning.
